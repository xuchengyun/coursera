# Solutions of Lecture 4

1. Take this [short interactive regex tutorial](https://regexone.com/).
2. Find the number of words (in `/usr/share/dict/words`) that contain at
   least three `a`s and don't have a `'s` ending. What are the three
   most common last two letters of those words? `sed`'s `y` command, or
   the `tr` program, may help you with case insensitivity. How many
   of those two-letter combinations are there? And for a challenge:
   which combinations do not occur?

   **Solutions:**

   To find the number of the words, run the following commands in your ternminal.

   ```bash
   cat /usr/share/dict/words | tr "[:upper:]" "[:lower:]" | awk "/(.*?a.*?){3}([^'][^s])?/" | wc -l
   ```

   Or use grep to achieve the same result.

   ```bash
   grep -icE "^(\w*?a\w*?){3}([^'][^s])?$" /usr/share/dict/words
   ```

   List the three most common last two letters with the following commands.
   If you are curious about the number of the cominations, you can just wipe out the `awk '{print $2}'` term.

   ```bash
   grep -iE "^(\w*?a\w*?){3}([^'][^s])?$" /usr/share/dict/words | awk '{print substr($0,length()-1)}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rnk1,1 | head -n3 | awk '{print $2}'
   ```

   To find the cominations that do not occur, run the following bash script.

   ```bash
   [todo]
   ```

3. To do in-place substitution it is quite tempting to do something like
   `sed s/REGEX/SUBSTITUTION/ input.txt > input.txt`. However this is a
   bad idea, why? Is this particular to `sed`? Use `man sed` to find out
   how to accomplish this.

   **Solutions:**

   We can use `-i extension` to edit files in-place and saving backups with the specified extension.
   If a zero-length extension is given, no backup will be saved.
   It is not recommended to give a zero-length extension when in-place editing files,
   as you risk corruption or partial content in situations where disk space is exhausted, etc.

4. Find your average, median, and max system boot time over the last ten
   boots. Use `journalctl` on Linux and `log show` on macOS, and look
   for log timestamps near the beginning and end of each boot. On Linux,
   they may look something like:

   ```bash
   Logs begin at ...
   ```

   and

   ```bash
   systemd[577]: Startup finished in ...
   ```

   On macOS, [look for](https://eclecticlight.co/2018/03/21/macos-unified-log-3-finding-your-way/):

   ```bash
   === system boot:
   ```

   and

   ```bash
   Previous shutdown cause: 5
   ```

   **Solutions:** (on Linux)

   ```bash
   journalctl | grep -E 'Startup finished in (\w\.?)+ \(kernel\) \+' | tail -n10 | sed -E 's/(.*) = (.*)s./\2/' | R --slave -e 'x <- scan(file="stdin", quiet=TRUE); summary(x)'
   ```

5. Look for boot messages that are _not_ shared between your past three
   reboots (see `journalctl`'s `-b` flag). Break this task down into
   multiple steps. First, find a way to get just the logs from the past
   three boots. There may be an applicable flag on the tool you use to
   extract the boot logs, or you can use `sed '0,/STRING/d'` to remove
   all lines previous to one that matches `STRING`. Next, remove any
   parts of the line that _always_ varies (like the timestamp). Then,
   de-duplicate the input lines and keep a count of each one (`uniq` is
   your friend). And finally, eliminate any line whose count is 3 (since
   it _was_ shared among all the boots).
6. Find an online data set like [this
   one](https://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesWikipediaZZ.htm), [this
   one](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/topic-pages/tables/table-1).
   or maybe one [from
   here](https://www.springboard.com/blog/free-public-data-sets-data-science-project/).
   Fetch it using `curl` and extract out just two columns of numerical
   data. If you're fetching HTML data,
   [`pup`](https://github.com/EricChiang/pup) might be helpful. For JSON
   data, try [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/). Find the min and
   max of one column in a single command, and the sum of the difference
   between the two columns in another.
